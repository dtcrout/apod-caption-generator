The impact theory of lunar origin can explain, for example, why Moon rocks returned by the Apollo missions have the same isotopic ratios as Earth rocks while the Moon seems deficient in heavy elements like iron. It can also explain a critical finding of the Lunar Prospector experiments - that the Moon's core is proportionally very small. If the Moon formed simply as a \"sister world\", its origin paralleling Earth's formation from the primordial solar nebula, it should have similar iron content and relative core size.

For example, this 1991 image of totality from atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii forms a fleeting snapshot of the mysterious corona's beautiful, intricate structures and streams. However in space, instruments can use occulting disks to simulate eclipses and more readily monitor the corona beyond the sun's edge. Combined observations from the space-based SOHO UCVS and shuttle-borne Spartan 201 experiments have recently contributed to a major advance in understanding the high-speed component of the wind of particles in the corona. They reveal evidence for magnetic waves within the corona itself that push solar wind particles along, like an ocean wave gives a surfer a ride.

Its moon, seen at 5 separate positions around a clockwise orbit, is estimated to be 13 kilometers wide.

Eugenia's moon has a nearly circular orbit with a radius of 1,190 kilometers which it completes once in 4.7 days. The orbit appears oval-shaped because it is tilted at a 45 degree angle to the line-of-sight. Knowing the moon's orbit allows astronomers to calculate the asteroid's mass.

The 1920s brought observations of spiral-nebulae that housed familiar but faint variable stars, and hence placed these nebulae much farther than anything else ever found.  The Milky Way, apparently, is itself a spiral nebula seen from the inside.  Soon interstellar dust was identified as the opaque material that blocks our view of distant spiral arms, confirming that our Sun was well away from the center.  As the twentieth century closes, galaxies are seen forming across the universe, and our Milky Way is referred to as a spiral galaxy quite similar to NGC 1288, as pictured above.", "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9912/ngc1288_vlt_big.jpg", "media_type": "image", "service_version": "v1", "title": "The Century that Defined Galaxy", "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9912/ngc1288_vlt.jpg"}, {"date": "1999-12-31", "explanation": "When the second millennium began, people generally knew that the Earth was round, but few saw much of it beyond their local village.  As the millennium progressed, humans mapped the continents, circumnavigated the globe, and determined the composition of the Earth.  The Earth started as the center of everything, but became a planet placed in the Solar System, which became placed in a Galaxy, which became placed in the Local Group of Galaxies, which became placed in an expanse so vast we call it just the Universe.  As millennium two ends people generally know what Earth looks like from afar, and how it is that all of humanity is confined to the surface of this fragile and watery globe.", "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9912/earthrise_apollo8_big.gif", "media_type": "image", "service_version": "v1", "title": "The Millennium that Defined Earth", "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9912/earthrise_apollo8.jpg"}]
