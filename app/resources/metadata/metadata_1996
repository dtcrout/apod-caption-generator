Both Jerry Bonnell and I (RJN) from APOD have been so inclined - both now and when Comet Halley came by in 1986. During these sessions, many good questions are asked and occasionally a humorous situation will arise. One was with a little girl. She waited so patiently for her turn to look through the telescope, hardly able to contain her excitement. Finally her turn came. \"Do you see the comet?\" I asked. \"Wow, wow, WOW!\" She beamed. \"You see it?\" \"No.\" One little boy seemed particularly bent on destruction. \"This telescope looks like a big gun,\" he volunteered. \"In some ways, it's even more powerful than a gun,\" I replied, hoping to challenge his imagination. \"Really?\" he countered. \"Can we shoot down the comet?\" \"How expensive is the telescope?\" is a fairly common question.

His notations are evident on the plate shown above (the image is a negative with stars appearing as black dots against the white background of space). By intercomparing plates, Hubble searched for \"novae\", stars which underwent a sudden increase in brightness. He found several on this plate and marked them with an \"N\".  Later he discovered that one was actually a type of variable star known as a cepheid - crossing out the \"N\" he wrote \"Var!\" (upper right). Thanks to the work of Harvard astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, cepheids, regularly varying, pulsating stars, could be used as \"standard candle\" distance indicators. Identifying such a star allowed Hubble to show that Andromeda was not a small cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy, but a large galaxy in its own right at a substantial distance from the Milky Way.

A bookish E. C. Herrick of New Haven, Connecticut correctly suspected in 1837 that this meteor shower was an annual event. Indeed it is now known to be a regular August shower caused by the yearly passage of the Earth through the orbiting debri left behind by periodic comet Swift-Tuttle. Since the bits of comet debri are moving along parallel orbits, on entering the atmosphere they leave fiery trails which appear to originate from a common radiant point in the sky, in this case in the constellation of Perseus. Dramatically illustrated in this composite video image made using MOVIE, meteors from the 1994 Perseids streak across the sky framed by the three bright stars of the asterism known as the \"Summer Triangle\". The image shows bright Perseids recorded that year from August 9 through 14. Here the trails appear nearly parallel as the camera was centered on the sky about 90 degrees from the radiant point. This year, European and North American observers should be able to view the shower near its maximum, about 90 meteors per hour, early Monday morning August 12, but the shower should be enjoyable on clear weekend nights (August 10,11) as well. After midnight is generally the best time for viewing. What's the best way to enjoy a meteor shower?
