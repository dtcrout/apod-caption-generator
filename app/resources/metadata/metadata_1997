They are so featureless and so poorly resolved, however, that their distances could not be determined.  Last Thursday, May 8th, the orbiting Beppo-Sax Satellite detected and precisely located a GRB (GRB970508), quickly relaying its position to astronomers. Within hours, many of the world's most powerful telescopes were re-pointed in the direction of the new GRB.  There they found a faint but variable optical source: a potential counterpart to the gamma-ray burst that was getting brighter.  Most importantly, continued scrutiny showed that this optical transient had absorption lines with a redshift of about 0.8 - the distance scale of galaxies and quasars. If this source and GRB970508 are related, the GRB itself must be many billions of light-years away and the 30-year controversy on the distance scale to GRBs will draw dramatically to a close. GRBs could move from the realm of astronomical mystery to useful beacons of the early universe.

M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale. In the center, two stars orbit inside a gaseous disk 10 times the orbit of Pluto.  The expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the disk creating the bipolar appearance.  Much remains unknown about the physical processes that cause planetary nebulae.", "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9712/m2-9_hst_big.jpg", "media_type": "image", "service_version": "v1", "title": "M2-9: Wings of a Butterfly Nebula", "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9712/m2-9_hst.jpg"}, {"date": "1997-12-24", "explanation": "30 Doradus is lit up like a Christmas tree.  Shining in light across the electromagnetic spectrum, 30 Doradus glows because of all the energetic processes that go on there.  A distinctive region visible in a Milky Way satellite galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 30 Doradus is a hotbed of star formation, supernova explosions, and ionized plasma. The above image is a composite of three pictures taken in three different wavelength bands of light.  Red represents X-ray emission created by gas as hot as 1 million degrees Kelvin. Green represents emission from ionized hydrogen gas, and blue represents ultraviolet radiation primarily emitted by hot stars.  At the conclusion of this symphony of star formation and light in a few million years, astronomers expect that a new globular cluster will have formed.", "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9712/30dor_qdw_big.gif", "media_type": "image", "service_version": "v1", "title": "30 Doradus Across the Spectrum", "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9712/30dor_qdw.jpg"}, {"copyright": "T.

Westward winds, deflected north by the circulation within the Great Red Spot, collide with Eastward winds at higher latitudes and generate the roiling, turbulent structures.
